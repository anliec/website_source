## About Me

I am a French computer science student graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a major in Machine Learning. I like to work on abstract topics such as applied mathematics, machine learning and algorithms. I have always loved building things, and computer science allows me to do so with as little physical constraint as possible, making it very exciting. I strongly believe that working as a team is the best way to make a project successful.


My favorite technologies range from Python and C++ to Bash, LaTex and libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. However, technology is always changing and learning new things is what makes me move forward.


I am passionate about making computers smart. Robotics and Machine Learning are my two favorite fields. Diving into data and thinking about edge cases drive me and make me happy to go to work.
